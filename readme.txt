SwiftUI Weather Program

Honestly just a basic weather app, just wanted to practice and learn more with SwiftUI and xcode. :)

TO RUN:
  - Best way would probably be to download the .zip of this project and open it in xcode.
  - Majority of the code lives in SwiftUi-weather > SwiftUi-weather > ContentView.swift

But highly encourage you to play around with the different files and hey if you break something in the code, just scrap what you have/downloaded and redownload it again from here :)
